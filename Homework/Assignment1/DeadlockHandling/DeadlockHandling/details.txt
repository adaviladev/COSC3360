arrays:
	available[1...m]: indicates the number of available resources of each type.
		available[j] = k => resource j has k instances

	max[1...n,1...m]: indicates the maximum number of instances of each resource type needed by each process. 
		max[i,j] = k means that process i needs a maximum of k instances or resource j

	allocated[1...n,1...m]: indicates the number of instances of each resource type currently allocated to each process.
		allocated[1...n,1...m] = k means that process i is allocated k instances of resource type j

	need[1...n,1...m]: indicates the remaining number of instances of each resource type needed by each process.
		need[i,j] = k means that process i still needs k instances of resources type j to complete exeution
		need[i,j] = max[i,j] - allocated[i,j]

	request[1...n,1...m]: indicates the number of instances of each resource type currently requested by each process.
		request[i,j] = k means that process i currently requests k instances of resource type j to continue execution
